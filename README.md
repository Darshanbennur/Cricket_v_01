Greetings Everyone
I'm a Beginner WebDeveloper and this is a Simple Project That i've tried to create based on a game that we used to Play Known as Handy Cricket.
In this there used to be two players at a time and they both used to first choose between Balling or Batting.
Then the Number of Overs were decided which were to be Played.
Then The Game Starts
Now the Batsman has to predict a score betwwen 1 to 6 and the Baller has to Guess it.
If the Baller fails to do that each time, then the Number shown by the Batsman would be his score on that ball. So on the Batsman Can increase his score till the
Baller has predicted his Next Hit.
So until the Baller Guess his Next Move correctly the Batsman Can increase his Total Score
Furthermore, if the Number of Overs gets finished the Batsman now comes to Ball and now the Baller can do Batting, altough if the Baller (who was prev. balling)
had gussed his score before all the balls were over he could have shifted to batting at that moment
Now the Baller have to Score the Total Runs + 1 run in order to win from the other Player (who was prev Batting)
So With same COnstraints The Batsman now has to score runs and the Baller now has to defend his score by guessing the Batsman's next move
I hope You all Like this Basic Game
Always Open for Suggestions!!
Thank You....
